Optimization Report for pipeline1.yaml
======================================================================

FILES:
  Original: tests/output/pipeline1_original.yaml
  Optimized: tests/output/pipeline1_optimized.yaml

======================================================================
ISSUES DETECTED:
======================================================================
  - [HIGH] Missing caching for Python dependencies, which can significantly speed up the installation process.
    Location: build.3
  - [MEDIUM] The lint job could run in parallel with the build job since it does not depend on the build output.
    Location: lint
  - [LOW] The checkout step is duplicated in both the build and lint jobs, which is unnecessary.
    Location: lint.1

======================================================================
APPLIED FIXES:
======================================================================
  - Missing caching for Python dependencies, which can significantly speed up the installation process.: Added caching for pip dependencies using actions/cache.
    Location: build.3
  - The lint job could run in parallel with the build job since it does not depend on the build output.: Removed the 'needs: build' dependency from the lint job.
    Location: lint
  - The checkout step is duplicated in both the build and lint jobs, which is unnecessary.: Removed the checkout step from the lint job.
    Location: lint.1

======================================================================
FIX VALIDATION:
======================================================================
  - [VALID] CACHING
    ✓ Found cache action: actions/cache@v3 in job 'build'
  - [VALID] PARALLELIZATION
    ✓ Reduced job dependencies from 2 to 1
  - [MANUAL_REVIEW] REDUNDANT
    ⚠️  Redundancy fixes require manual review

======================================================================
EXPECTED IMPROVEMENT:
======================================================================
Applied 3 optimization(s), improved build speed through caching, enabled parallel execution.
